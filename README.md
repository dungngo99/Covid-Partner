***Inspiration***
In 2020, people are becoming more disconnected from their local communities, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rage on. As a result, social anxiety has become prevalent in our society: the need for a sense of community/belonging never been more important. People in the same community or neighborhood will understand their problems
more thoroughly and can help others in a much more efficient and effective way. So why not build an app that allows people to connect with their neighbors online and provide them with the tools necessary to organize and improve their community.


***What it does***
Covid-Partner is an web app to help remotely connect people in the community level during the time when social distancing or self-isolation is highly encouraged.

The app will ask people to sign up or login if they already had an account. User authentication can help the app provides more personal experiences and have their information more secure. Also, a user can update their information or provide their location for the better reach to his/her neighborhood.

The app also provide public pages, such as dashboard, discussion, donation, and tips, that reveal Covid-19 news and other valuable information.

***How I built it***
Covid-Partner is designed to be an web-based app, developed in Visual Studio Code, with features including Facebook/Google as third-party for user authentication and Firestore for storing user information.

***Challenges I ran into***
Our team members had to balance hackathon with other important commitments. We have to spend much time brainstorming the ideas. Finally, some of us have to deal with new technologies and learn them fast, such as ReactJS and Firebase.

***Accomplishments that I'm proud of***
Everyone has his or her own skills that are complementary to one another. We worked really hard as a team, cooperated really well with each other even though our work styles and timezones were very different. Finall, we keep working on the project and never give up on challenges til the end as effective communication is limited.

Our app has the potential to address all the community-level problems as our app serves as a intermediate to connect people with each other. People who are in the same neighborhood can understand their problems and help each other much more effectively and efficiently.

What I learned
The potentials that technologies can help solve new problems, particularly the pandemic that we have never experienced before within 100 years.

What's next for Covid-Partner
We will keep improving this app, add new features, and make it available to all the people in need.

Built With
ReactJS, Bootstrap, React Shards, and Firebase
